I have chosen Git Bash, Notepad++, and Firefox.  I am currently running Windows 7 and have experience with most of these programs with the exception of Git Bash.  Git Bash seemed fine doing everything that was needed for this homework assignment and was similar to what I’m used to on Ubuntu.  
I’m a minimalist by nature so I kept most the programs I use regularly.  I can relatively easily roam around bash, write some code in Notepad++, and test it on Firefox with familiarity.  This is the main reason for the choosing of this web design environment.  Any suggestions would be appreciated though.
