After visiting jasonsantamaria.com I can easily tell that he is a graphic designer just by his homepage.  The home looks clean with decent sized images and blog entries showing off his writing and skill.  I feel like there should be something before the blog entries though after the site title.  He has a nice picture and brief description with easy links to follow him.  I feel these could be placed at the top for better visibility.  He does market himself quite nicely with recent projects, books, and sales links near the bottom.
I feel his article section could be organized better as they seem to just be plain text with a filter.  More pictures and a better layout might make this more useable.  He obviously needs to get his portfolio up so vistitors can better view his skillset.  But, it is nice to have a link to his old site in the meantime.  The reading section is kind of plain but is nice for making the site a little money.
The About page is one of my favorite.  Most of it seems done right with a nice picture a little write-up with some nice previous publishing.  The links to older versions of the site is a nice little touch to show his own personal development and capabilities.

Overall, I liked the site.  It could have some better design choices in my opinion.
