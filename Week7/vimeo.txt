Vimeo to me has great site design in my personal opinion.  It has all the most important information at the very top so the user can see everything when they first enter the site.  You have a big prompt to sign into the site or via Facebook.  It has a nice catch-line "Your videos belong here" which really sums up the site and makes the user feel welcome.

The artwork is a nice touch which hints at creativity and adds some spice to the site.  There is in the middle of the site a big red eye grabber video file to get your attention.  This highlights staff pics and other videos users enjoy.  This is a good way to get people into the site and viewing videos.  Scroll a little further down and you have nice images that continue with the same theme.  These highlight all the benefits of joining Vimeo.  

The "Why is Vimeo different?" section is a nice touch because most users will wonder this.  Why not YouTube?  Here is where they talk about not having adds which have infected most other video sites.  After this information is the up-sell for Vimeo Plus which is needed for any free video site.  The site closes with "Ready to enter a world of awesome?" which ends with a soft sell.  The theme at the bottom is nice and consistent with the top and the join button is big and not too intrusive.

I feel like this site reads like a commercial.  It highlights all the key benefits and differences of the product.  It gives you ways to explore and test drive the system.  Then, it offers you a way to upgrade or simply join for free.  It is smartly put together and hits all the points it needs to.
