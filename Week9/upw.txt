United Pixelworkers is a pretty neat site.  I am not too big of a fan of a mass image home page myself.  This page seems to load fine on my end for having so many images which hints at good caching and efficient coding.  I feel the site is harder to navigate then most because everything is a block so your eye has to try harder to see differences.

The top banner is clean and good looking to the eye with the logo of the brand, job opportunities, key content tabs, and a shopping cart.  This is one of my favorite design elements of this site.  I find it strange that the location of the newsletter sign up is towards the middle.  I feel like this should be up top with the banner.  The time sensitive shirts are highlighted in red and put up top which is a good business move.  I feel the text blocks are hard to read.  At the bottom you see social invites and another sign up for the newsletter field.  The bottom buttons match with the top which is clean looking and another high point.

I feel like this site did some things well and others not so well.  They could probably have less images on the home page with possibly bigger images highlighting different deals.  I like the top and bottom banners and are high points of the site for me.  The block text is distracting and there is bad placement of the newsletter opt in I feel.  The site does have good load for being what it is too.
