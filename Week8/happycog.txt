Happy Cog is a cool little site that tells a story as a website should.d.  The site starts off with a big Zappos advertisement which should generate some referral income for the site.  Further down you get to see all of the big names that the site has done business with.  This will grab the attention of the populace with brand recognition.

The big graphic and announcement of the Webby award winning shows that the site is prestigious and recognized.  There is also a big red "now hiring" for someone looking for a job with Happy Cog in Philadelphia.  Down further are nice graphics that mesh well together highlighting the site's blog.  This is quite common now a days but this is done in a way that attracts potential readers.  Down further you learn more about the company and how it started and what it stands for.  This is always good to give people a background to your company.  Then there is the Network section which shows the how Happy Cog connects with other services to give an all in one product.  At the bottom there is a way to contact key members of the organization with nifty map features.  The text at the bottom doesn't work well on my Firefox browser though.  There is a nice non intrusive way to sign up for the newsletter if you made it this far on the site and also the soft-sale to the right. The best part to me is the "Thank You" which should be on more websites.

Overall, I enjoyed the website at Happy Cog.  It really hits on all the key things you want to tell about your business.  There were also cool creative touches that I feel made this site stand out.  My personal favorites being the blog pictures and thank you at the end.  I feel like this was a solid website with good design which comes off well to potential customers.
