	<p>I am trying to make a nice personal site that highlights some of my achievements and goals.  I want a landing pad where people can get a feel for who I am (and see I can actually create a site).</p>
	<p>I was a lot closer to agreement with participants in this card sort.  This may just be because it is a pretty simple layout as of now (less options, less variety).</p>
	<p>Everyone across the board agreed on where the home page should go which makes sense, seeing as it is the most important page.  Then there was a toss up between work and school and obvious subjectivity for the sorter.  I see school as my main focus so I put more priority with it.  Most of the participants felt that hobbies were of less importance which makes sense compared to the other options.  Overall, a nice sort to help guide me.</p>
