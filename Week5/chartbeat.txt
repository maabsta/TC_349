Chartbeat seems to be a snazzy little site.  It has a nice red 30 day trial button to grab your attention and get you hooked as a customer.  The site looks overall clean with nice color contrast.  The constantly updating "people across all sites" graphic is a nice touch.  The fact that it moves and is interactive is nice without bogging down the site.

The site looks overall clean with obvious attention to detail.  The social media icons with another big red button "join" to catch your eye.  They smartly highlight some of there high end clients to show history.  Scrolling down more you see more animated graphics with red grabbing your eye and only key information being shown.

Overall, I like the whole design of the site.  It is simple in some areas and spiffy in others to show its prowess.  It's a good example of blending newer features of web design while keeping what has always worked.
