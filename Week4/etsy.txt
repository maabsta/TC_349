Etsy to me is a decent little site.  The colors on the front page are kind of boring but classic.  The red coloring over the Etsy button really draws your attention on the site for good branding.  The site is heavy on pictures which is to be expected of an "artsy" site.  Like Amazon and Ebay it has some featured items on the front page which is nice. Obviously they have some targeted ads with their iPhone accessory banner.  

You can sign up for the newsletter which is a great way to get returning customers which is always good.  The recently listed is a good touch to show the fluidity of the marketplace.  They have featured shops and recent blog posts really adding to the site's social presence.

Overall, the site has most of the key features I would expect in a marketplace.  The thing that I didn't like was how boring the site layout was.  I feel the designer could have done a better job making the main page more appealing so people want to leap in and buy something.  Use some of the artists who design trinkets to help make the site a little snazzier maybe.  Either way, much could be improved.
