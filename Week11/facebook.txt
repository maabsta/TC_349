The only mobile site I frequently use would be Facebook.  Overall, I like the design as it contains most of the main features I'm used to on the full site with the biggest drawback being the load times.  This is to be expected with the amount of data that Facebook loads in a page.

The site sticks with the typical Facebook blue.  You have access to the "news feed" by default and can move to other sections through a drop-down on the upper left.  All the main features are at the top: friend requests, messages, notifications, and a friend search.  Below that are the things you can do: change status, upload a photo, or check in to a location.  The site is simple but lets you do the majority of what there is to do on Facebook in a mobile form.

I enjoy the mobile version of Facebook as it gets the job done with room for improvement.  My biggest issue has always been loading of the mobile site but this could be my carrier as well.  The mobile site sticks to the roots of the main site and gives you a healthy dose of features.  The interface seems well thought out and really meshes with the social aspect of the site.  This makes my most used mobile site.
