<p><b>Site Review</b></p><p>The site: panic.com is almost laughable by the ammount of bad deisgn decisions made.  Random text is blocked with different color, there is purple text on purple background.  It does have cool little pop up buttons for some of its services though.  There is also more bad blue on blue background near the bottom.  There is broken boxes near the request help.  The whole front page just leaves a bad impression. </p><p>The site looks like it was poorly translated from another language and never really looked at again.  There are easy to fix little errors all over the place.  Really a site like this would leave a bad first impression on any potential customer and any service.  The only thing going for it was the pop up buttons which seemed to hint towards bad translating or porting over.  Overall just not a good webpage.
