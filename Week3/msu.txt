	Msu has a great homepage to be honest.  It has pictures to visually catch your eye and keep you browsing.  It has some flash phases through multiple images making the site feel alive.  The flash doesn't seem to slow down the load time of the site.  

	You can clearly see the tabs for different users on the top with most importance going to the money makes in grey.  Below that are the links to access the student, staff, and visitors which could be highlighted a little better in my opion.

	There is MSU specific news to be found.  Links to video, books, and all the social media site.  MSU does a good job of keeping the most important information on the homepage.  There is a nice "Meet so and so student" blurb that tells just enough information to grab your attention.  There is a nice bold support MSU button on the bottom which is not too intruding and blends into the site.

	Overall, I have always liked MSUs website as it tells you everything you need to know about MSU or gives you a link to more information.  It is a well done and laid out website.  Now Angel on the other hand....
